		<h1>Why I Love My School?</h1>
		<p>My school strikes the perfect balance between modern education and vintage architecture. The vintage buildings of my school never fail to mesmerize me with their glorious beauty.

        However, their vintage architecture does not mean it is out-dated, as it is well-equipped with all the contemporary gadgets. I see my school as a lighthouse of education bestowing knowledge as well as ethical conduct upon us. In contrast to other schools, my school does not solely focus on academic performance. In other words, it emphasizes on the overall development of their students</p>

        <h1>What has My School Taught Me?
        </h1>
        <p>
         If someone asked me what I have learned from my school, I wonâ€™t be able to answer it in one sentence. For the lessons are irreplaceable and I can never be thankful enough for them. I learned to share because of my school. The power of sharing and sympathy was taught to me by my school. I learned how to be considerate towards animals and it also one of the main reasons why I adopted a pet.</p>
